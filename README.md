# F1 Pit Stop Strategy Simulator üèéÔ∏è‚õΩ

This repository contains a **Formula 1 pit stop strategy simulator**, capable of generating and comparing different combinations of tire compounds and pit stops for a race. It helps analyze which strategy is fastest based on the track, tires, and random events such as Safety Cars (SC) or Virtual Safety Cars (VSC).

---

## Features

- Automatically generates all possible strategies up to a maximum number of pit stops.
- Simulates a race considering:
  - Tire degradation
  - Fuel load effect
  - Random events (SC and VSC)
  - Pit stop time adjustments depending on events
- Compares strategies and calculates total race time.
- Exports results to CSV and visualizes lap times.

## Installation

It is recommended to create a virtual environment with Python 3.10+:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Example Output
The simulator produces a CSV with the results, including:

Strategy: sequence of compounds used per stint.

Total: total race time.

Pit in Laps: laps where pit stops occurred.
Example: 
| Strategy     | Total     | Pit in Laps |
| ------------ | --------- | ----------- |
| 2-stop S‚ÜíS‚ÜíM | 86:24.205 | \[22, 44]   |
